💼 Bank Marketing Machine Learning Project
This project applies machine learning models to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on their demographic and behavioral attributes. The dataset used is the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

📂 Dataset
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository - Bank Marketing
File: bank.csv
Separator: ; (semicolon)
🎯 Target Variable
y: Whether the client subscribed to a term deposit (yes or no)
🔍 Features
